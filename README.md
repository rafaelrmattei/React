# ⚛️ React Projects

This repository contains projects I built during my learning journey with React, especially through the **Rocketseat Ignite track**.  
They apply modern front-end development concepts such as React, TypeScript, Next.js, TailwindCSS, styled-components, Context API, hooks, design systems, API integration and a lot more.
